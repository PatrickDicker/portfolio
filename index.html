		<div id="aboutMe">I'm in my element when tinkering around with doo-hickeys and what-nots. You can find me somewhere on a mountainside,
or on a long bike ride. My life is a lesson in solving old problems with new tools. I enjoy making life more straightforward, 
and most people seem to appreciate that.

			Bogdanoff Quiz <br><span class="elaborate">
